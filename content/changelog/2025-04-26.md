# What's this about?
[MJMLiquid](https://www.mjmliquid.com) has been live for roughly 4 months now, since Dec 2024. I've thoroughly enjoyed working on this piece as a side project and have been super heartened ❤️ to see many people using it, both in and out of where I work.

I've always admired how other products make use of changelogs and the addition of the [changelog](/changelog) page for MJMLiquid is just a simple way to track some of my ongoing efforts with MJMLiquid over time and see how far we've brought it since it's inception.

# Updates
Outside of that, this page should also provide some update posts here and there on MJMLiquid, so stay tuned if you're interested!
