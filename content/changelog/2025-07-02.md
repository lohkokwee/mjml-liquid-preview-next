It's been a hot minute since MJMLiquid's [last update](https://www.mjmliquid.com/changelog/2025-04-27)!

This update features something that I've been working on on the side for a while now, exporting images as PDFs!

# üöÄ What's new?
* _A new `Export image` facility._ After entering the export menu with `alt` + `3`, `alt` + `i` allows you to immediately export the rendered preview as a PDF file to share with your colleagues ü§ù.

# üå± What's changed?
* _Export menu vs. copy menu._ Internally, we've also updated the `Copy manager` naming convention (for our copy features) to `Export menu` (in line with the new export image feature). This allows a more semantic grouping of the facilities that we provide on MJMLiquid.

# ü™û A quick note!

Unfortunately, as an engineer, this feature isn't one that I'm most proud of! If you use it to export the stock MJML template that I provided, you'll notice that the header and the button is slightly misaligned - it seems like some of the compiled HTML/CSS code isn't being respected by our export libraries ([`html2cavas`](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/) or [`jsPDF`](https://artskydj.github.io/jsPDF/docs/jsPDF.html)). This was the problem that has been holding me back from this release for a bit. 

Nonetheless, people have been requesting for this feature and it has been stuck in the [roadmap](https://www.mjmliquid.com/about) for awhile now. I'm certain this release would help a good amount of people üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

Do let me know if you have a solution to this, would be keen to hear and understand what I'm doing wrong!
