title: "v1.2 ‚Ä¢ Exporting original template data"
excerpt: "Preserve liquid templates while exporting your compiled HTML üì¶."
type: "Changelog"
---

This update features an additional export option when you attempt to export your compiled HTML from MJMLiquid.

# üöÄ What's new?
* _Additional options to determine how you'd like to export your compiled HTML code_. Upon entering the HTML export menu with `alt` + `3` followed by `alt` + `h`, you would observe some new options. Simply hit `alt` + `option` + `<number>` to determine which export option you would like the compiled HTML code to be exported in ü§ì.

# üå± What's changed?
* _Export options._ Internally, we've added a [new component](https://github.com/lohkokwee/mjml-liquid-preview/blob/2fcf65ff0e7c5a77d927081c68ab6fce952edfef/components/export/export-options.tsx#L48) to faciliate export option creation through radio buttons. Provide the [export configuration](https://github.com/lohkokwee/mjml-liquid-preview/blob/2fcf65ff0e7c5a77d927081c68ab6fce952edfef/components/layout/export-manager.tsx#L57) and the export option dialog would render accordingly with the corresponding numbered standard hotkey hints for each option üìê.
* _Safeguards for hotkey hooks._ Additionally, we've also added some [additional safeguards](https://github.com/lohkokwee/mjml-liquid-preview/blob/2fcf65ff0e7c5a77d927081c68ab6fce952edfef/hooks/use-hotkeys-handler.ts#L26) for the hotkey hooks to prevent accidental global triggers üí•.

# ü™û A quick note!

This was requested in a GitHub issue [here](https://github.com/lohkokwee/mjml-liquid-preview-next/issues/1) and it brings me so much joy to be able to finally achieve this since I'm certain that if one person needs this, several other probably do as well.

A large part of the feature involved envisioning the flow the user would go through when navigating through MJMLiquid. Simply adding an additional option in the already growing export dropdown menu made the UX feel clunky.

A new dialog to indicate potential actions a user could take felt like a good way to not add to the clutter of the dropdown menu while enabling users to intuitively navigate the export options available.

Do let me know if you have any feedback on this and I'm excited for everyone to try it out!
